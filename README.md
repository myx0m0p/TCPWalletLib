# TCP Wallet Lib

## Main goals
* The library implements a blockchain wallet for EOSIO based network.

## Most interesting features
* A straightforward API to use - call the method and provide required arguments.
* The client application does not need to know anything about the concrete blockchain implementation.
* Send tokens, buy/sell all kinds of resources (CPU/Network/RAM), vote for the nodes.
* Fetch real-time users properties related to the blockchain.
